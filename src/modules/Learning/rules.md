## Scenarios
****1. **Answering a Question Correctly**
Given I have a pool of questions for different concepts
When I am asked a question from the pool
And I provide the correct answer
Then the application should acknowledge my correct answer
And increase the interval before that specific question is asked again**

2. **Answering a Question Incorrectly**
Given I have a pool of questions for different concepts
When I am asked a question from the pool
And I provide the incorrect answer
Then the application should notify me of the incorrect answer
And reset the interval for that specific question

3. **Answering Multiple Questions**
Given I have multiple concepts with questions in the pool
When I am asked questions throughout the day
Then I should be able to answer multiple questions
And each question should follow its own interval for review
